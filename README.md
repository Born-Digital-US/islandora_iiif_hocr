# Islandora IIIF hOCR

## Introduction

This module is part of the Islandora project and extends the Islandora IIIF component module
to support IIIF search results annotations. This provides the back-end support for
on-page highlighting of search results within image viewers such as [Mirador](https://github.com/ProjectMirador/mirador)
via the [Islandora Mirador](https://github.com/islandora/islandora_mirador) module.

## Installation

Include with `composer require born-digital/islandora_iiif_hocr`

### Configuring Search Highlighting annotations

Although it is not expressed as a hard requirement, this module assumes tue use of https://github.com/discoverygarden/islandora_hocr, including the installation and configuration of the [solr-ocrhighlighting](https://github.com/dbmdz/solr-ocrhighlighting) Solr plugin.
